## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Oren. I'm a computer scientist with a strong passion for linguistics. I hold a PhD in Computer Science from the [Technical University of Darmstadt](https://www.tu-darmstadt.de). My research interest is [digital text forensics](https://downloads.webis.de/publications/papers/potthast_2019b.pdf), especially [authorship verification](https://paperswithcode.com/task/authorship-verification), which was also my [dissertation topic](https://tuprints.ulb.tu-darmstadt.de/19861).

After my studies, I worked for almost a decade as a research assistant at the [Fraunhofer Institute for Secure Information Technology SIT](https://www.sit.fraunhofer.de/en/). During this time, I acquired a broad spectrum of NLP topics, which I still use in many areas today.

Apart from NLP, in recent years I have increasingly been working in the field of computer vision, where I have been focusing on various topics such as [image classification](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/13/22/4712), [segmentation](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9356353), [image captioning](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10462-023-10488-2), [visual question anserwing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11033), [feature matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17592) and [multimodal learning](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00371-021-02166-7).

In my (quite limited) spare time, I like to build open source projects and explore new technologies around machine learning, NLP and CV. I hope that what I have developed and published so far can be useful to you. 

Enjoy your stay here...
